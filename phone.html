		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>In our society, it's almost a necessity to have a smart phone, yet why aren't we in consensus about which phone is the best? How can we even start to compare phone companies when we can't even decide which OS is best? We'll leave the spec differences to the tech experts, but we can look at some market trends to see how Android and iOS compare to each other.</p>

		<h1>What Do These Graphs Tell Us?</h1>
		<p>The graph above shows the the past year's activity levels between Android phones and iOS phones. It seems that iPhones are used more than Android phones, but Android phones are very slowly catching up. This may be happening due to the new iPhone 6's issues (such as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/i-walked-into-an-apple-store-and-i-was-able-to-bend-the-iphone-6-plus-pretty-easily-2014-9">bending</a>) hurting its sales. Let's look at some more data to see if Apple's latest phones are being left on the shelves.</p>

		<h1>New iPhone Adoption Rates Are High</h1>
		<p>It's important to note that these graphs are not scale independent, but the data we can draw from them is useful. In the first two weeks of its release, the iPhone 6 (not including iPhone 6 Plus) had an adoption rate of just over 5%. Two weeks after the iPhone 5s' release, it had an adoption rate of under 2.5%. iPhone 6's adoption clearly increased, so what else could it be? Perhaps, Android phone's market growth exceeds that of the iPhone's. It appears that Android's market share is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5">increasing very rapidly compared to iOS</a>. Now, we ask, "Why is the activity change from the first graph so slow when Android's market share is clearly growing so quickly?"</p>

		<h1>Why Are Activity Levels So Slow To Change?</h1>
		<p>The difference may come from <a href="http://www.dazeinfo.com/2014/05/27/ios-users-32-likely-make-app-purchases-android-users-engaged/">brand loyalty</a>. One thing that economists have difficulty measuring is consumer sentiment. This may very well be what is keeping the iOS over the Android OS. It's not terribly surprising either. Apple is known to spend large amounts of money in their marketing and advertisement. We can see the effectiveness of advertising and marketing by looking at one of Apple's newly acquired companies, Beats Electronics. Beats Electronics holds <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/beats_by_dre_market_share_how_the_headphones_company_conquered_the_market.html">about 60%</a> of the market with their headphones. Yet with this dominance, most experts say that their headphones are nowhere close to being the best for its price range. Actually, Beats Electronics' advertising and marketing team is so good, that they've practically taken the market by simply making their product the coolest.</p>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>Android phones are slowly catching up on iPhones in terms of activity level, but the narrowing of this margin is seemingly slow. Android phones may be catching up on iPhones due to their relatively high growth in the market. Android's market share has greatly increased throughout the recent years, so why are we seeing this slow growth in activity level? This could be due to Apple's customers being loyal to the iPhone. We can see a clear example of how consumer sentiment is a huge factor in adoption and sales by looking at Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. There is also the issue that Android phones are made by a number of companies. This lack of unity may dissuade iPhone users from switching. Apple makes their phones nice and easy to upgrade; users know what to expect. That could be the reason why they're so loyal.</p>
