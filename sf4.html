	<h1>Ultra Street Fighter IV</h1>
	<p>Anyone who hit the arcades around two decades ago, surely remembers the classic game of Street Fighter II. The latest installment in the series, Street Fighter IV, brings out the kid in me. When I'm not out and about, I love sitting down and practicing, striving to become better. For the past two years, I went to Las Vegas to attend and compete in the Evolution Championship Series, the biggest fighting game tournament in the world. In my game alone, there were around 2,000 entrants each year. In my best showing, I placed <a href="http://evo2014.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssf4_e54.html">third in my pool</a>, one of my losses coming from a well-respected veteran player, John Choi (who later went on to upset and knock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Umehara">Daigo Umehara</a> out from the tournament). Competing is always an amazing experience and only inspires me to try harder. I'm still young at the game, but if I keep practicing, I have no doubts that I will become an even stronger player. I plan to make traveling for competition a recurring event, as it allows me to gain greater experience and see the world.</p>
