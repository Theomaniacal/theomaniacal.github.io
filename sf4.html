	<h1>Ultra Street Fighter IV</h1>
	<p>Anyone who hit the arcades around two decades ago, surely remembers the classic game of Street Fighter II. The latest installment in the series, Street Fighter IV, brings out the kid in me. When I'm not out and about, I love sitting down and practicing, striving to become better. During this past summer, I went to Las Vegas to attend and compete in Evo 2014 Championship Series, the biggest fighting game tournament in the world. In my game alone, there were around 2,000 entrants. I placed <a href="http://evo2014.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssf4_e54.html">third in my pool</a>, one of my losses coming from a well-respected player, John Choi (who later went on to upset and knock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Umehara">Daigo Umehara</a> out from the tournament). It was an amazing experience and only inspires me to try harder. I'm still young at the game, but if I keep practicing, I have no doubts that I will become an even stronger player. If time and resources permit, I would love to attend Evo again next year.</p>
