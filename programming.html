	<h1>Programming and Development</h1>
	<p>An increasingly important part of my life has been coding. Starting with an interest in game development, I learned the language <a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>. In September 2014, I entered the Electronic Game Developers Society Game Jam 2014. To my pleasant surprise, my team won <a href="http://gammaprogram.utexas.edu/news/2014-ut-game-jam/">best in show</a>! With this motivation, I am now working on bigger projects. In order to better my game development skills, I have also been <a href="http://artofgamedesign.com/">reading on game design</a>. It's a fascinating field that actually relates a lot to marketing analysis. A game designer's main job is to create a game that is able to provide a dynamic experience from multiple lenses. Similarly, a marketing analyst works to find a product that will perform well in a market by ensuring the product creates positive experiences within multiple consumers.</p>
	<p>I'm also learning to become better at web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) along with other practical languages such as Python.</p>
